# What is a Computer-Use Agent?

A **computer-use agent** is an AI system that interacts with computers just like humans â€” moving the mouse, clicking, typing, and navigating through user interfaces. These agents can handle tasks ranging from everyday computer use to complex gaming.

## What can they do?

Short answer: **Anything!**&#x20;

If a human can do it with a computer, then with the right data during training, so can a computer-use agent. Imagine your personal agent gaining the ability to do the following tasks:

* **Gaming**: Play first-person shooters like Valorant, build structures in Minecraft, or join you in your favorite co-op games.
* **Development:** Write and debug code, build using IDEs and GUI development tools
* **Everyday Tasks**:
  * Book flights and hotels on travel websites.
  * Order food from delivery apps.
  * Fill out forms and applications.
  * Manage your email inbox
* **Creative Work:**
  * Edit videos, create digital art using the mouse, use design software, etc..

This is possible by having an AI model look at a screen, interpret the state, and generate corresponding actions, such as moving the cursor to specific coordinates (e.g., 50, 180) or typing commands or text (e.g., 'aloha'). These models are trained to mimic human interactions with a computer, allowing them to perform tasks seamlessly across various applications and interfaces.&#x20;



## The viralmind Difference - LAMs

LAMs (Large Action Models) are a breakthrough extension of state-of-the-art language models, enhanced with specialized neural pathways for human-like computer interaction. By training LLMs through immersive gameplay and real-world tasks, we create expert models that seamlessly blend natural language reasoning with native interface manipulation. Unlike traditional approaches, LAMs develop rich, interleaved understanding of both language and action - think of it as adding a motor cortex to your favorite LLM.

Existing computer-use frameworks rely on censored APIs or OCR-based pipelines. ViralMind's Large Action Models (LAMs) are purpose-built for **direct, native interaction with interfaces**. OCR-based agents may:

* Struggles with dynamic or information-dense UIs.
* Misinterpret visual elements, leading to frequent errors.
* Fail to scale effectively for complex or real-time tasks (e.g., gaming or creative workflows).



In contrast, LAMs like what's deployable from viralmind:

* Embed native action understanding directly in LLM architecture - trained on real-world interaction data from crypto's most sophisticated users and communities
* Achieve higher accuracy by understanding visual and interactive data natively.
* Operate faster and more reliably, as they bypass intermediate OCR steps.
* Scale across diverse scenarios, from high-dexterity gaming to high-density enterprise tools, _without additional frameworks_.
* **Zero friction integration with current frameworks!**
  * [One-click deploy](train-your-own-agentic-lams.md) a LAM using your favorite LLM and just \~50 tasks using the training gym - instantly boost your OCR-based agent by 30% on real work benchmarks. But that's just the beginning. 100 tasks unlocks native visual-action understanding that makes OCR obsolete. At 5000 tasks? We're talking [exponential capability growth](vm-1-the-future-of-large-action-models.md) that transforms your agents into a truly embodied era. We pioneered with OCR-type computer-use [years ago](https://github.com/ddupont808/GPT-4V-Act) - now we're pioneering what comes next.
