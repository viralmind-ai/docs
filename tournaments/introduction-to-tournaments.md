## Overview

Tournaments are **competitive** events where you guide an AI agent through a **specific challenge**. Only **one** tournament runs at a time, featuring a clear objective (e.g., completing a game level, executing a complex computer operation, etc.). If you succeed in achieving the tournament goal, **you win the entire reward pot**—no sharing required.

#### Key Points

* **One Tournament at a Time**: Once a tournament finishes, a **new** one will be announced.
* **All-or-Nothing Reward**: If you succeed, you get **100%** of the pot.
* **Step-by-Step Commands**: Each action you instruct (move + click, type + enter) is executed by the agent.
* **Automated Rewards**: Tournaments have a clear, automated reward condition that decide who gets the pot.

#### Key Points

* **Bigger Reward Pools**: Tournaments often have larger reward allocations, making them **highly competitive**.
* **1 Tournament at a Time**: Once a tournament finishes, a **new** one will be announced.



#### How to Participate

1. **Check Announcements**: Watch for new tournaments in our Telegram or on the **Tournaments** page.
2. **Register**: Ensure you meet any entry requirements (could be free or might require holding/staking $VIRAL).
3. **Guide the Agent**: During the tournament window, carefully issue commands to complete the challenge.
4. **Win the Pot**: If you successfully meet the tournament’s goal, you’re awarded **the entire** reward pot.

#### Example Tournament Scenario
