# ðŸŒ€ Training Pools

The **Training Pool** is the core funding mechanism within The Forge, enabling **AI training environments (Gyms) to distribute rewards to contributors**. Gym creators fund a pool using **$VIRAL, USDC, or their own native tokens**, ensuring a steady flow of incentives to attract high-quality AI training demonstrations.

Training Pools enable **dynamic, competitive AI training**, where contributors earn based on the quality of their demonstrations, and Gym owners can scale their AI models efficiently.

***

## **How Training Pools Work**

### **1. Funding the Pool**

* Gym creators deposit **$VIRAL, USDC, or their own token** to finance AI training. A 20% platform fee is taken from each deposit.
* The pool is used to **pay workers who submit high-quality demonstrations**.
* Web3 startups can stake $VIRAL to unlock the ability to use their own token.

### 2. **Dynamic Payouts Based on Demonstration Quality**

* Workers **record demonstrations**, which are then **scored by ViralMindâ€™s data quality agent**.
* **Higher-quality submissions receive larger payouts**, ensuring AI models learn from the best data.
* Example: A $0.20 bid per demonstration means:
  * **85% quality submission:** Worker receives **$0.17**, and **$0.03 is refunded to the pool**.
  * **Submissions below 50% quality:** No payout, and the full amount is refunded to the training pool.

### 3. **Bidding System for Worker Participation**

* Gym owners **adjust pricing** based on demand.
* If a Gym sets **$0.20 per demonstration** but receives few submissions, it can **raise the bid to $0.30** to attract more workers.
* This creates **an organic marketplace**, ensuring that AI models are trained efficiently without overspending.

### 4. **Reputation-Based Incentives**

* ViralMind implements a **Worker Reputation System**, rewarding consistent, high-quality contributors.
* **Workers with strong track records gain priority access to higher-paying tasks**, improving training efficiency.

## **Why Training Pools Matter**

ðŸ”¹ **Incentive-Driven AI Training** â€“ High-quality demonstrations are rewarded fairly, ensuring **AI agents learn from the best data sources**.

ðŸ”¹ **Scalable and Competitive Marketplace** â€“ The **bidding system** allows Gym owners to **dynamically control costs and training speed**.

ðŸ”¹ **Tokenized AI Training Economy** â€“ The system creates **constant demand for $VIRAL**, as businesses must acquire and fund pools to train AI models.

ðŸ”¹ **Reputation and Quality Control** â€“ Workers are **ranked by performance**, ensuring AI agents **improve efficiently** without low-quality data slowing progress.

## **Example Training Pool Funding Scenarios**

### **Web2 Enterprise Example**

* **Company Funds:** $20,000 USDC
* **Flat Setup Fee:** $250
* **20% Platform Fee:** $4,000
* **Remaining Worker Pool:** $15,750
* **Demonstration Price:** $0.20 per task
* **Total Demonstrations Funded:** 78,750

### **Web3 Startup Example**

* **Project Funds:** $20,000 USDC equivalent in $VIRAL
* **Flat Setup Fee:** 1 SOL (\~$100)
* **20% Platform Fee:** $4,000
* **Remaining Worker Pool:** $16,000
* **Demonstration Price:** $0.20 per task
* **Total Demonstrations Funded:** 80,000

These funding mechanisms **scale AI training based on demand, ensuring sustainable growth** while keeping contributors incentivized.
