# Welcome to viralmind.ai

### What is viralmind.ai?

> Imagine AI agents that genuinely use a computer like a human, spanning everything from **gaming** to **productivity**.

_**viralmind.ai is that reality**_. We're an open-source, decentralized collective intelligence platform that **empowers everyone to train & deploy frontier agents** for games and desktop tasks. Play our AI-powered training gym or join human vs AI tournaments, gather imitation-learning data, and earn $VIRAL while contributing to **next generation of AI** â€” agents with powerful LAMs at their core. ðŸš€

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/csclone-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter (1).gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>Demonstration: A computer-use AI playing Counter-Strike in real-time using mouse and keyboard inputs, trained on human gameplay recordings, was able learn how to imitate behaviour such as peeking and spray control.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Who are we?

We are a team of passionate AI researchers and engineers â€” devs from MIT, Microsoft, and more â€” with years of experience building computer-use agents. Our mission is to democratize frontier AI research by bringing powerful Large Action Models (LAMs) to the crypto community. Integrated with $VIRAL, we can efficiently gather and reward high-quality user demonstrations, fueling the development of these LAMs. In turn, our agents learn from real computer-use data, enabling them to interpret on-screen tasks and generate keyboard & mouse actions directly.

> If you want AI agents that **DO** things, not just talk about or hallucinate clicking them, youâ€™re in the right gitbook!

## Why viralmind?

The blessing of computer-use, is _any_ application you can click is now a tool for your agent. Using **one-click fine-tuning** of GPT-4o on just **50 tasks** collected in our gamified training gym, our agents score a **\~30%** higher success rate than purely OCR-based baselines. Imagine scaling to **5,000 tasks** or moreâ€¦ Brace yourself for exponential growth.

> Imagine telling your voice assistant "let's play this new co-op game", and they hop on as an in-game companion, capable of coordinating your next raid or speedrun while youâ€™re taking that important call. Itâ€™s no longer just talkâ€”our AI can actually play. As part of our vision, weâ€™re dedicating a portion of the agent platformâ€™s earnings toward the $VIRAL communityâ€™s marketing efforts, ensuring that the world sees the future weâ€™re building together.

## What do you provide?

Everything you need to:

* **Build your own computer-use agent quickly** through our intuitive & fun Training Gym
* **Join the AI agent revolution** with $VIRAL, providing data via games and earning rewards.
* **Deploy and watch agent tournaments** where game-playing & computer-use agents show off their skills in exciting live-streams, often humans vs AI with large drops of SOL or $VIRAL.
* **Trade the agentic knowledge you generate** (coming soon)
* **Deploy powerful, highly capable agents on-chain or on your desktop** (coming soon)
