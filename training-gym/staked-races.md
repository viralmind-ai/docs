# Staked Races 🏎️

### Overview

Staked races are higher risk/higher reward. You **stake** your $VIRAL tokens to join the race. If you fail trap tasks (or choose not to complete them), you may forfeit some or all of your stake. If you succeed, you typically earn **more** than what you staked due to the redistribution of forfeited stakes and the race structure.

#### Staking Process

1. **Stake**: You lock in X amount of $VIRAL to the race’s smart contract.
2. **Platform Fee**: A small portion (e.g., 5–10%) goes to the Training Gym treasury.
3. **Trap Tasks**: Automated tasks that ensure only quality attempts pass.
4. **Winners’ Pool**: The rest of the stake pool is distributed among successful participants.

#### Example Breakdown

* 20 participants each stake 2,000 $VIRAL 👉 total 40,000 $VIRAL
* 10% fee 👉 4,000 to treasury, leaving 36,000 in the base pool
* 5 participants fail or drop out, forfeiting their stake 👉 10,000 more added to the pool = 46,000
* 15 winners split 46,000 $VIRAL 👉 3,067 each, well above the 2,000 staked.
