# Free Races 🏇

### Overview

“Free” in the Training Gym means **no direct stake** is required—however, you must **hold** at least **X $VIRAL** in your wallet for **Y days** before the race starts. This ensures you’re part of the $VIRAL ecosystem without risking a stake.

#### Example Flow

1. **Hold $VIRAL**: Acquire and keep 1,000 $VIRAL in your wallet for 7 days (the exact amount and holding period vary by race).
2. **Race Sign-Up**: Enter the free race. Because you’ve satisfied the “hold requirement,” your entry is confirmed.
3. **Complete Tasks**: Work through the race tasks. Some tasks may be simple, while “trap tasks” require correctness.
4. **Reward Distribution**: After the race ends (and the **minimum** participants is met), winners share a **prize pool** of $VIRAL funded by the Training Gym’s treasury.

#### Why We Require Holding $VIRAL

* **Prevents Abuse**: Users can’t just jump in with no ecosystem interest.
* **Increases Token Health**: Encourages participants to hold $VIRAL, reducing quick “in-and-out” behavior.
