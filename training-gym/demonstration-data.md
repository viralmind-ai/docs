# ðŸ“Š Demonstration Data

## Demonstration Data

Every aspect of our platform is designed to generate high-quality training data for multimodal computer-use agents. From AI-generated tasks to expert demonstrations, we capture comprehensive data that helps train AI to understand and replicate human computer interactions.

### Demonstration Files Structure

Each recorded demonstration consists of multiple files:

1. **input\_log.jsonl** - Detailed event log of all user interactions
2. **meta.json** - Metadata and configuration information about the demonstration
3. **recording.mp4** - Video recording of the screen during the demonstration

When you record a demonstration in the Training Gym, the system captures all your interactions in a standardized JSON format. Each user interaction is saved as a separate event in a JSONL file (JSON Lines format) called `input_log.jsonl`. Understanding this format can help you create more effective demonstrations.

#### Event Structure

Each recorded event has the following structure:

```json
{
  "event": "eventType",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific properties
  },
  "time": 1234567890
}
```

* **event**: The type of interaction (e.g., mousemove, mousedown, keydown)
* **data**: Object containing event-specific details
* **time**: Timestamp in milliseconds when the event occurred

#### Event Types

The system records the following types of events:

### Key Identifiers

The system supports both Windows and Mac key formats:

**Windows Format Keys**

* Letters: `A`, `B`, `C`, ... `Z`
* Numbers: `Zero`, `One`, `Two`, ... `Nine`
* Modifiers: `Shift`, `LeftCtrl`, `RightCtrl`, `LeftAlt`, `RightAlt`
* Navigation: `Left`, `Right`, `Up`, `Down`, `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`
* Special: `Space`, `Return`, `Backspace`, `Escape`, `Tab`, `Delete`, etc.
* Symbols: `BackTick`, `BackSlash`, `ForwardSlash`, `Plus`, `Minus`, etc.

**Mac Format Keys**

* Letters: `KeyA`, `KeyB`, `KeyC`, ... `KeyZ`
* Numbers: `Num0`, `Num1`, `Num2`, ... `Num9`
* Modifiers: `ShiftLeft`, `ShiftRight`, `ControlLeft`, `ControlRight`, `Alt`, `AltGr`, etc.

* Symbols: `BackQuote`, `Equal`, `Minus`, `LeftBracket`, `RightBracket`, etc.

#### Event Processing

The demonstration system processes these raw events into higher-level actions:

1. **mouseclick**: A brief press and release at nearly the same position
2. **mousedrag**: A sequence of mouse movements with the button held down
3. **type**: A sequence of character inputs combined into text
4. **hotkey**: Special key combinations like keyboard shortcuts

## Tips for Quality Recordings

* **Clear Actions**: Make deliberate, clear mouse movements and clicks
* **Consistent Typing**: Type at a steady pace to ensure accurate capture
* **Complete Workflows**: Ensure you capture all steps without skipping any
* **Minimize Errors**: While the system can handle corrections, try to minimize misclicks or typing errors

### Demonstration Metadata (meta.json)

The `meta.json` file contains important contextual information about each demonstration:

```json

      "time": 1741119480000,                      // Timestamp when reward was calculated
      "max_reward": 7                             // Maximum possible reward for completing this task (in $VIRAL)
    }
  }
}
```

### Video Recording (recording.mp4)

Each demonstration includes a screen recording that shows exactly what the user saw and did during the task. This provides:

1. Visual context for all the recorded interactions
2. Confirmation of the UI state during each action
3. A reference for how the task should be completed
4. Visual verification for quality evaluation

Understanding all components of the demonstration data helps you create high-quality submissions that achieve better scores in the grading system, maximizing both AI training effectiveness and your rewards.
