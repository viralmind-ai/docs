# Frequently Asked Questions ❔

### 1. Do I Need to Stake $VIRAL for a Free Race?

No. For **free races**, you only need to **hold** a minimum balance of $VIRAL in your wallet for the specified “hold period.” You do not risk losing those tokens—they remain in your control, as long as you meet the hold requirement.

### 2. What If I Fail a Trap Task in a Free Race?

You simply **receive no portion** of the prize pool. You don’t lose any tokens from your holding balance.

### 3. Can I Join Multiple Races at Once?

Yes! You can hold enough $VIRAL for free races **and** stake in staked races simultaneously, as long as you meet each race’s requirements.

### 4. How Do I Get Notified About New Free Races?

**Join our Telegram** ([link](https://t.me/viralmind)) to get instant announcements about new free races and other updates.

### 5. What Happens If a Race Doesn’t Reach Its Minimum Participants?

That race is canceled. For staked races, your stake is returned. For free races, the prize pool remains unused in the treasury.
