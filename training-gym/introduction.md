# Introduction üöÄ

## What is the Training Gym?

The **Training Gym** is a platform where users can participate in AI-related ‚Äúraces‚Äù (multi-task challenges) for fun and rewards. Participants can choose from:

* **Free Races**: Require holding a certain amount of $VIRAL but do not require any token to be staked or spent.
* **Staked Races**: Require staking $VIRAL, and reward pools come from the participants‚Äô stakes, plus any forfeited tokens from those who fail.

By mixing **free** and **staked** races, we aim to onboard newcomers quickly while rewarding advanced users with higher stakes and higher potential gains.

## Key Features

* **Community-Submitted Tasks:** Users can submit their own tasks, contributing to a wide range of **diverse data** and challenge types‚Äîspanning everything from simple code exercises to advanced AI tasks.
* **Automated Trap Tasks:** Certain tasks have evaluators that detect malicious or incompetent submissions.
* **Token Holding & Staking:** For free races, just **hold** $VIRAL for a specific period to qualify. For staked races, you can **risk** your $VIRAL for bigger potential payouts.
* **Clear Incentives:** Successful participants in **staked races** can earn more than they risk, thanks to the redistribution of forfeited stakes from those who fail trap tasks.
* **Build your own agent:** One of the most exciting features of the Training Gym is the ability to export your performance data to **build your own AI agent**. By participating in races, you generate high-quality training trajectories that can be:
  * Exported in OpenAI JSONL, ChatML, or raw video + JSON formats.
  * Used to fine-tune your own Large Action Model (LAM).
  * Applied directly to your own projects, whether for gaming, office automation, or custom workflows.
  * **Coming soon:** Trade your data on a agentic skill market

The Training Gym not only rewards participants but also enables them to take the next step in developing powerful, personalized AI agents.
