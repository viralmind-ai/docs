# ℹ️ Introduction

## **What is the Training Gym?**

The **Training Gym** is a platform where users can participate in AI-related “demonstrations” (multi-task challenges) for fun and rewards. Participants complete demonstrations for $VIRAL rewards.

## **Key Features**

* **Community-Submitted Tasks:** Users can submit their own tasks, contributing to a wide range of **diverse data** and challenge types—spanning everything from simple code exercises to advanced AI tasks.
* **Automated Task Evaluations:** Tasks have AI-powered evaluators that detect malicious or incompetent submissions.
* **Token Holding:** To participate in a demonstration, just **hold** $VIRAL to qualify.
* **Build your own agent:** One of the most exciting features of the Training Gym is the ability to export your performance data to **build your own AI agent**. By participating in races, you generate high-quality training trajectories that can be:
  * Exported in OpenAI JSONL, ChatML, or raw video + JSON formats.
  * Used to fine-tune your own Large Action Model (LAM).
  * Applied directly to your own projects, whether for gaming, office automation, or custom workflows.

The Training Gym not only rewards participants but also enables them to take the next step in developing powerful, personalized AI agents.
