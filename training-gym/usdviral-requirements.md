### Holding vs. Staking

* **Holding**: For free races, you only need to maintain a minimum balance for a certain time. You don’t lose it if you fail tasks, but you also won’t get it “returned” because it was never locked.
* **Staking**: For staked races, your tokens are locked in the contract. You risk forfeiture if you fail trap tasks, but successful participants can gain **above** their original stake.
