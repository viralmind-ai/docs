# How It Works ü§î

### Step-by-Step

1. **Set Up Your Wallet**
   * Install a compatible crypto wallet
   * Acquire $VIRAL tokens from an exchange or via airdrop/community giveaways.

   2. Look at the requirements (minimum $VIRAL hold vs. stake amount).
3. **Complete Tasks**
   * Each race has multiple tasks, including ‚Äútrap tasks‚Äù with automated evaluators.
   * Successfully finishing tasks (passing the evaluator checks) qualifies you for reward distribution.
4. **Get Rewards**
   1. For **staked races**, rewards come from the pool of all participants‚Äô stakes minus any fees, plus forfeited stakes from failed participants.
   2. For **free races**, the prize pool is funded by the Training Gym treasury (seeded by the platform) but requires you to hold a certain amount of $VIRAL for a specified period.



### Minimum Participants

* Each race sets a **minimum number of participants** before it officially ‚Äúlocks in.‚Äù
* If the minimum isn‚Äôt met within a set time, the race is canceled (staked amounts are returned; free-race pools remain unclaimed and revert to the treasury).
