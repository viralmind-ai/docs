# VM-1: The Future of Large Action Models

### What is VM-1?

**VM-1** is the family of **powerful agent models** that we are building by leveraging the **collective intelligence** gathered through the ViralMind Training Gym. Designed to be the next frontier in Large Action Models (LAMs), VM-1 models will:

* **Empower agents to play games**, complete tasks, and navigate complex interfaces.
* **Handle real-world work** with fluid, human-like interactions.



### The Vision

We aim to release **two tiers** of VM-1 models to serve both developers and businesses:

1. **Open-Source Smaller Models**:&#x20;
   * Compact, efficient models for specific applications.
   * Ideal for developers who want to **replace OCR modules** in their existing pipelines.
   * Works as a plug-and-play extension for any LLM, supercharging its capabilities without needing to train a full LAM.
2. **Foundational LAMs via API**:
   * A **larger VM-1 model** available via API.
   * Trained on millions of action tokens for gaming, work automation, streaming, and more.
   * Powered by **$VIRAL**: Usage fees reinvested into marketing and growth, creating a **self-sustaining ecosystem**.
3. **Potential Partnerships**:
   * Collaboration opportunities with gaming studios, enterprise software providers, and crypto platforms to expand VM-1’s reach.
   * Strategic alliances to integrate VM-1’s capabilities into broader AI ecosystems, enhancing both adoption and impact of VM-1, and significantly enhancing the capabilities of interested agent frameworks.



## Why VM-1?

#### For Gamers

* Imagine an agent that can **play games with you** seamlessly—not just following commands but engaging in cooperative, competitive, or creative gameplay.
* We'll train your agent to master specific games, genres, or strategies using your own data.

#### For Professionals

* Replace repetitive, manual work with **AI agents** powered by VM-1.
* Streamline tasks like form-filling, document processing, and more with **foundational LAMs** designed for real-world scenarios.

#### For Developers

* Don’t have the resources to train a full LAM? Use **VM-1 smaller models** to upgrade your existing tools and frameworks. Alternatively, we allow you to [Train your own agent!](https://app.gitbook.com/o/9oqH0XqBofA7GqeOE7cT/s/ZMAF56RKrCfGk29ahtJw/~/changes/12/build-your-own-agent)
* Bridge the gap between text-based LLMs and computer-use functionality effortlessly.
